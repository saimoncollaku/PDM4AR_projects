# Exercises and Projects PDM4AR
This repository contains the solution code for the exercises and projects of the course **PDM4AR** (Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots), taught by Professor **Emilio Frazzoli** at ETH Zurich in 2024.

## Overview
The repository is organized as follows:
- The **master branch** contains solutions to individual exercises.
- The **spaceship** and **highway** branches contain the **final group projects**.
- The exercises focus on the **implementation of classic algorithms** related to planning, such as:
  - **A\***
  - **Collision checkers**
  - **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
  - and other related topics.

## Exercise Descriptions
The descriptions and details for each exercise can be found in the following locations:
- [Course Exercise Documentation](https://pdm4ar.github.io/exercises/)
- The **docs** folder within the repository.

The **spaceship** and **highway** branches contain the final group projects, implementing advanced planning and decision-making strategies in different environments.
